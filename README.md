Adding the "Responsive" aspect of these html files seemed like a never ending experience.   
Chewing up the hours.  The problem with being able to infinitely adjust positions is that  
you end up adjusting positions infinitely!  I learned if I am going to go this route, all  
styling has to be done with CSS so it is available to be changed due to screen size.
